It is the 2nd largest city and minicipality in The Netherlands. With a population of more than 650,000 living in an area of 324 km<sup>2</sup>, Rotterdam is known for its university, riverside setting, lively culture life, maritime heritage and modern culture, and not to forget, it is a home to over 180 nationalities.\n\nHaving a plan to look for real estate in Rotterdam, I decided to analyse Rotterdam for this project. I am particularly interested in having the knowledge of where the best place to live in this city. In my opinion, the best place to live can be defined as the area which has:\n1. short distance to important public places, i.e. supermarket, hospitals, and public transport\n2. lower population density \n3. affordable housing price\n\nI understood that my interest might not be the same as the other, but to my opinion the above categories could fit the stakeholders who just start their professional career.\n\nWe will use our data science knowledge to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Data <a name=\"data\"></a>"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Based on definition of the problem, factors that will influence stakeholder's decision are:\n* distance to important public places\n* population density \n* average house price\n\nWe decided to use regularly spaced grid of locations, centered around city center, to define our neighborhoods.\n\nFollowing data sources will be needed to extract/generate the required information:\n* list of neighborhoods in Rotterdam, its population density and the average house price can be obtained from this website https://www.pdok.nl/\n* number of venues, their type and location in every neighborhood will be obtained using **Foursquare API**\n* geospatial coordinate of neighborhoods in Rotterdam will be obtained by using Geocoder Python package"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
